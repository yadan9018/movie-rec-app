# movie-rec-app
I will attempt to build a movie recommendation app that suggests movies to users based on their preferences (e.g., genre, actors, etc.).
I will use Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn to build the recommendation model.
For the app interface, you can use Streamlit or Flask to create a web-based UI.
Itâ€™s Good for practicing working with datasets, building recommendation models, and learning how to deploy your model into an app.
This project is a good balance between learning AI fundamentals and building a functional app, making it an ideal beginner project you can complete in a month!
